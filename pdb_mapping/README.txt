This is directory the contains a map for each TfR1-GP1 model. In each map the residue for model is mapped to the corresponding residue in the original 3KAS structure downloaded from the PDB.

Contents:

model_maps/
	A directory with all of the maps.
	
modeller_fasta_alignments/
	A directory containing the alignments made by modeller for the homology modeling process. These were converted to fasta format.

map_helper.py
	This a helper python script with functions used to create the maps

make_pdb_maps.py
	This a a python script that generates the maps. You need the fasta files generated by the following script	

get_fasta_alignment.py
	This is a python script that generates fasta formatted alignmets. The two necessary arguments are the name of the virus Ex. junin and the four letter code representing that virus (ex. JUNV)
